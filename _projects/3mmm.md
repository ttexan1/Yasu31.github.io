The robot was originally created as the end-of-year project for 3rd year students at UTokyo(Dec. 2017 ~ Jan. 2018), and I have later expanded its capabilities so it can be controlled through LINE, a popular messaging platform in Japan.
It runs ROS, and I have also made it compatible with the motion planning library MoveIt!, so it can be moved to avoid collisions with itself or other obstacles. The body was designed in Fusion 360 and made with laser-cut MDF, and the robot arm is made by Kondo Kagaku.

As part of the May Festival exhibits at UTokyo, I have added the LINE messaging feature. To avoid users controlling the robot from a distance, a verification system using QR codes was created. Please see my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs9X8V0TJgQ">newer video</a>    (in Japanese) for a demo video.
