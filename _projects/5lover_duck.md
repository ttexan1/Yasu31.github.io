Presented at [JPHacks 2017](https://2017.jphacks.com/result/), a student hackathon. It was a five-person team comprised of students from the University of Tokyo.

Designed to prevent drowning accidents in the bathtub. The Duck has an accelerometer built inside, and its data is sent wirelessly to a host PC. When it is detected that the human is drowning/passed out, it sends an alert to the server, which can update the Web interface as well as call family members on the phone.

I had great fun in contributing to this as the hardware engineer(the innards of the duck), and witnessing my talented teammates in action.
