Presented at [FEEL 2017](http://lis.s367.xrea.com/feel2017.html), an educational space event held in Sagamihara. Created by 4 members(including me) of the space science communication organization, [Live in SPACE Project](http://lis.s367.xrea.com/index.html).

This "space probe" has multiple sensors inside(an accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature sensor and light sensor), communicates with the mission control(a PC) wirelessly and works on a battery. This lets the children hold and play around with the probe, guessing the roles of each sensor and learning about space exploration in the process. We also had a panel describing actual space missions, and the data that they collected by using the same types of sensors as found on LiS ONE.
